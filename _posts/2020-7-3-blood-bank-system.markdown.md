## System Functional Requirements

- Donors can search for nearby collectors.
- Donors that have already donated in the span of the last three months cannot donate again
and itâ€™s checked by the collectors.

## Methodology Solution:
By using a REST architectural style which uses HTTP calls for communication
through messages that rely on the HTTP standard: Each request sent by the client through (POST, GET, ... etc.) returns a response
with the required page or action.

The advantage of using REST API is the flexibility it provides by sending different
data based on the calls. This will help with building the website dynamically, and it
can be scaled up.

## Software Requirements:
- HTML, CSS,Javascript
- Bootstrap
- Nodejs, Express
- MongoDB
